- Virtual environment tools (included in Python)
- Necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CodeBluDev/Pyton-Camara-Script
    cd Pyton-Camara-Script
    ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**: This script will create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: If the virtual environment isn't activated automatically, activate it with:
